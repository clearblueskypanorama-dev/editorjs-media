# Media Tool

Media Block for the [Editor.js](https://editorjs.io).

This is a fork of the image block: https://github.com/editor-js/image

## Features

- Uploading file from the device
- Pasting copied content from the web
- Pasting media by drag-n-drop
- Pasting files and screenshots from Clipboard
- Allows adding a border, and a background
- Allows stretching media to the container's full-width

**Notes**

This Tool requires server-side implementation for the file uploading. See [backend response format](#server-format) for more details.

## Installation

Get the package

```shell
yarn add @envidual/editorjs-media
```

Include module at your application

```javascript
import MediaTool from '@envidual/editorjs-media';
```

Optionally, you can load this tool from [JsDelivr CDN](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@envidual/editorjs-media@latest)

## Usage

Add a new Tool to the `tools` property of the Editor.js initial config.

```javascript
import MediaTool from '@envidual/editorjs-media';

// or if you inject MediaTool via standalone script
const MediaTool = window.MediaTool;

var editor = EditorJS({
  ...

  tools: {
    ...
    media: {
      class: MediaTool,
      config: {
        endpoints: {
          byFile: 'http://localhost:8008/uploadFile', // Your backend file uploader endpoint
          byUrl: 'http://localhost:8008/fetchUrl', // Your endpoint that provides uploading by Url
        }
      }
    }
  }

  ...
});
```

## Tool's settings

![](https://capella.pics/c74cdeec-3405-48ac-a960-f784188cf9b4.jpg)

1. Add border

2. Stretch to full-width

3. Add background

Add extra setting-buttons by adding them to the `actions`-array in the configuration:
```js
actions: [
    {
        name: 'new_button',
        icon: '<svg>...</svg>',
        title: 'New Button',
        toggle: true,
        action: (name) => {
            alert(`${name} button clicked`);
        }
    }
]
```

**_NOTE:_**  return value of `action` callback for settings whether action button should be toggled or not is *deprecated*. Consider using `toggle` option instead.

## Output data

This Tool returns `data` with following format

| Field          | Type      | Description                                                                               |
| -------------- | --------- |-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| file           | `object`  | Uploaded file data. Any data got from backend uploader. Always contain the `url` property |
| caption        | `string`  | media caption                                                                             |
| withBorder     | `boolean` | add border to media                                                                       |
| withBackground | `boolean` | need to add background                                                                    |

```json
{
    "type" : "media",
    "data" : {
        "file": {
            "url" : "https://www.tesla.com/tesla_theme/assets/img/_vehicle_redesign/roadster_and_semi/roadster/hero.jpg"
        },
        "caption" : "Roadster // tesla.com",
        "withBorder" : false,
        "withBackground" : false,
        "stretched" : true
    }
}
```

## Backend response format <a name="server-format"></a>

This Tool works by one of the following schemes:

1. Uploading files from the device
2. Uploading by URL (handle media-like URL's pasting)
3. Uploading by drag-n-drop file
4. Uploading by pasting from Clipboard

### Uploading files from device <a name="from-device"></a>

Scenario:

1. User select file from the device
2. Tool sends it to **your** backend (on `config.endpoints.byFile` route)
3. Your backend should save file and return file data with JSON at specified format.
4. Medial tool shows saved media and stores server answer

So, you can implement backend for file saving by your own way. It is a specific and trivial task depending on your
environment and stack.

The tool executes the request as [`multipart/form-data`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST), with the key as the value of `field`  in configuration.

The response of your uploader **should**  cover the following format:

```json5
{
    "success" : 1,
    "file": {
        "url" : "https://www.tesla.com/tesla_theme/assets/img/_vehicle_redesign/roadster_and_semi/roadster/hero.jpg",
        // ... and any additional fields you want to store, such as width, height, color, extension, etc
    }
}
```

**success** - uploading status. 1 for successful, 0 for failed

**file** - uploaded file data. **Must** contain an `url` field with full public path to the uploaded medium.
Also, can contain any additional fields you want to store. For example, width, height, id etc.
All additional fields will be saved at the `file` object of output data.

### Uploading by pasted URL

Scenario:

1. User pastes an URL of the media file to the Editor
2. Editor pass pasted string to the Image Tool
3. Tool sends it to **your** backend (on `config.endpoints.byUrl` route) via 'url' in request body
4. Your backend should accept URL, **download and save the original file by passed URL** and return file data with JSON at specified format.
5. Image tool shows saved medium and stores server answer

The tool executes the request as `application/json` with the following request body:

```json5
{
  "url": "<pasted URL from the user>"
  "additionalRequestData": "<additional request data from configuration>"
}
```

Response of your uploader should be at the same format as described at «[Uploading files from device](#from-device)» section


### Uploading by drag-n-drop or from Clipboard

Your backend will accept file as FormData object in field name, specified by `config.field` (by default, «`media`»).
You should save it and return the same response format as described above.

## Providing custom uploading methods

As mentioned at the Config Params section, you have an ability to provide own custom uploading methods.
It is a quite simple: implement `uploadByFile` and `uploadByUrl` methods and pass them via `uploader` config param.
Both methods must return a Promise that resolves with response in a format that described at the [backend response format](#server-format) section.


| Method         | Arguments | Return value | Description                                                                                         |
| -------------- | --------- | -------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| uploadByFile   | `File`    | `{Promise.<{success, file: {url}}>}` | Upload file to the server and return an uploaded media data                                         |
| uploadByUrl    | `string`  | `{Promise.<{success, file: {url}}>}` | Send URL-string to the server, that should load media by this URL and return an uploaded media data |

Example:

```js
import MediaTool from '@envidual/editorjs-media';

var editor = EditorJS({
  ...

  tools: {
    ...
    media: {
      class: MediaTool,
      config: {
        /**
         * Custom uploader
         */
        uploader: {
          /**
           * Upload file to the server and return an uploaded media data
           * @param {File} file - file selected from the device or pasted by drag-n-drop
           * @return {Promise.<{success, file: {url}}>}
           */
          uploadByFile(file){
            // your own uploading logic here
            return MyAjax.upload(file).then(() => {
              return {
                success: 1,
                file: {
                  url: 'https://codex.so/upload/redactor_images/o_80beea670e49f04931ce9e3b2122ac70.jpg',
                  // any other media data you want to store, such as width, height, color, extension, etc
                }
              };
            });
          },

          /**
           * Send URL-string to the server. Backend should load media by this URL and return an uploaded media data
           * @param {string} url - pasted media URL
           * @return {Promise.<{success, file: {url}}>}
           */
          uploadByUrl(url){
            // your ajax request for uploading
            return MyAjax.upload(file).then(() => {
              return {
                success: 1,
                file: {
                  url: 'https://codex.so/upload/redactor_images/o_e48549d1855c7fc1807308dd14990126.jpg',,
                  // any other media data you want to store, such as width, height, color, extension, etc
                }
              }
            })
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }

  ...
});
```
